Command line for the win

CMD CHALLENGE is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills!'

The step I followed in using SFTP command_line tools.
Local Terminal Procedure:

I have a file of my required screenshot png's
Open my local terminal
Locate the saved command line screenshorts
Then copy the SFTP command and password from Sandbox
Navigate to the Alx-system_engineering-devops
Then, I put the screeshots png file into the Alx-system_engineering-devops Directory

Intranet Procedure:
Open my terminal
Navigate Alx-system_engineering-devops Directory
I create command_line_for_the_win folder.
I created a README.md File
I move the imported png's into the command ... folder
Then, I git add, commit and pushto Github.


I hope you understand my detail explanation.

Best Regards.
