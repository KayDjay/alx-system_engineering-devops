Specifics about this infrastructure:
A second server is added for downtime check when maintainace is ongoing
A load balancer is added for traffic distribution
The load balance uses Weighted Least Connection, Servers are weighted, and requests are directed to the server with the fewest connections.
Active-Passive: If the active server fails, the passive server immediately takes over until the active one recovers.

Issues about the Infrastructure:
There is measure for SPOF with the addition of server 02
No firewall and no secure socket layer certification
No monitoring to check for system health status
