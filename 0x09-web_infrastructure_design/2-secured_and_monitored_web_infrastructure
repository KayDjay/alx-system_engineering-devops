Infrastructure Specifics:
Firewalls have been implemented for enhanced security to all information going into te the server. It filterer
Firewalls, whether software or hardware-based, block unauthorized network access. They scrutinize incoming and outgoing data based on set rules, allowing only compliant data through.
HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP, employing data encryption for transfers. When an HTTPS request is made, the server responds with a public key and SSL certificate. An SSL handshake occurs, where the client provides matching credentials, enabling data decryption on the client's end.
 Monitoring tools gather data about application and server operations and performance. They highlight anomalies affecting performance, guiding troubleshooting efforts to specific problem areas.
 Continuous data collection occurs during application and server operations. Metrics like performance, availability, and user experiences are tracked, and any issues are promptly identified and addressed.
 Initial setup involves the deployment of monitoring tools capable of assessing metrics, such as queries per second, to gauge traffic handling and scalability.

Infrastructure Issues:
 Opting for SSL termination can compromise the security of sensitive transactional data, as transactions should occur over secure connections.
 Relying on a single MySQL server poses scalability challenges and introduces a single point of failure for the web infrastructure.
 Servers housing identical components can lead to resource contention (CPU, Memory, I/O, etc.), resulting in suboptimal performance. Pinpointing issues becomes challenging, and such a setup lacks scalability.
